This workshop will present some Python tools, frequently used in data science including the Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Matplotlib among others.

=== Aimed for people interested in ===

* Productivity tools for data science in python
* Best practices for data manipulation and visualisation
* Relevant to modules: SE_16, SE_25

=== Format ===

Short lecture like units inter-spaced with exercises.

=== Requirements ===

* Basic knowledge of Python
* A computer with Python 3, Jupyter notebook and the Python modules: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn
* Join the slack channel `#-se_lu_49-datasci`


The material of this workshop is highly based in the courses [Python-Course]([https://github.com/MPIDS/Python-Course) and [Introduction to programming with python](https://github.com/MPIDS/introduction_to_programming).
